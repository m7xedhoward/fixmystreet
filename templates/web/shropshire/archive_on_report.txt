FixMyStreet is being updated in Shropshire to improve how problems get reported.

As part of this process we are closing all reports made more than 3 months before the update.

All of your reports will have been received and reviewed by Shropshire but, if you believe that this issue has not been resolved, please open a new report on it.

Thank you.
