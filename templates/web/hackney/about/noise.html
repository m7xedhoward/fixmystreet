From Thursday 20th January 2022, a new reporting form is available for you
to report ongoing or one-off noise. Although you will still be able to view
reports prior to this date through the old system, you will no longer be able
to log updates or add new reports on "Report a Problem" for Noise. This can
now be done on our new system <a href="https://noise.hackney.gov.uk/">NoiseWorks</a>.
Prior reports made before this date will not be available in NoiseWorks. If you
reported a noise report prior and you want to provide an update you will need
to go to the new system to re-report it.
