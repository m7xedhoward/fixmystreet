Subject: Your reports on [% site_name %]

Hello [% user.name %],

FixMyStreet is being updated in [% cobrand.council_area %] to improve how problems get reported.

As part of this process we are closing all reports made before the update.

We noticed that you have [% report_count %] old [% nget('report', 'reports', report_count) %] on the system, which we've listed below.

All of your reports will have been received and reviewed by [% cobrand.council_name %], so if your report is no longer an issue, you don't need to do anything.

If you believe that the issue has not been resolved you can report it again here: [% cobrand.base_url %]

[% FOR report IN reports %]

[% report.title %]

Reported [% report.time_ago %] ago.

View report: [% cobrand.base_url_for_report( report ) %]/report/[% report.id %]
